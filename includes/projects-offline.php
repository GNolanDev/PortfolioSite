                    A very early project, I wanted to learn how to embed maps and add layers and custom points and labels in my websites. After experimenting with Openlayers & Google Maps I found Leaflet to be a good mix of features, ease of use and lack of cost. Added OpenStreetMap for mapping data & experimented with the Geolocation API on my local XAMPP server. I combined this with some early work on providing secure account login & sessions to enable a user to dynamically add new locatons by clicking on the map. These would then be added to an SQL database for retrieval and display on the map. I had fun creating a custom png icon & shadow too, finding out a lot about vector/scalar graphics and how to use editors in the process. Once I had learned enough, I mothballed the project at the early prototype stage on my local development machine & moved on to my 'social undistancing' app.
